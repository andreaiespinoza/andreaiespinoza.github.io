            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service is something that has always been close to my heart. There have been so many kind people
          who have served me and helped me grow in my life, and service is the way that I can give back to
          people in my community. There are some organizations that have helped me in my goal to serve my
          community. I volunteer for an organization called <a href="http://www.breakawayministries.org">Breakaway Ministries</a>. Breakaway Ministries
          is a bible study on campus, and I am part of the Street team. As a member of the street team,
          I get the opportunity to serve the student body by giving Student’s free coffee and donuts
          in the mornings or by giving out snacks around campus.

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way that I am able to serve others is through <a href="https://www.grace-bible.org/">Grace Bible Church</a>.
          I am able to serve students on Sunday mornings by helping students feel welcome
          and on Wednesday nights by helping facilitate a bible study. I get to help 
          students as they go through college and experience the highs and lows that come
          from being a student. It is an honor to be able to serve at Grace because people
          from Grace helped me so much when life got difficult coming to college. I am also able
          to help families enjoy the Sunday morning service without distractions by helping serve
          children in Sunday school. I love being a part of the kids ministry at Grace and I 
          enjoy spending time with the joyful kids that I help teach.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got the opportunity to serve children all over the world this summer
          through a Nonprofit called <a href="http://www.compassion.com">Compassion International</a>. Compassion’s mission
          statement is “Releasing Children from Poverty in Jesus’ Name.” I interned 
          for Compassion as a Software Developer intern so not only did I get to serve children,
          I also got to do it by coding which is something that I love doing.
