            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in College I have gotten the opportunity to serve in with some amazing people that have
            helped grow me and shape me into the person I am today. My freshman year I started to serve in a
            Ministry that I have loved getting to be a part of.
            I volunteer for an organization called <a href="http://www.breakawayministries.org">Breakaway Ministries</a>.
            is a bible study on campus, and I am part of the Street team. As a member of the street team,
            I go on campus and tell people about Breakaway through holding banners or serving coffee and donuts. Serving with
            Breakaway I have been challenged in so many ways. I have grown in sharing my faith, learning how to interact with
            so many different kinds of people, and getting out of my comfort zone. It truly has been one of the most growing
            experiences that I have had during my time in College. Deciding to volunteer for Breakaway has been one of the best
            decisions that I have made in my time at Texas A&M University. Not only have I gotten to serve with a ministry that
            I love so much, I have also made friendships that will last a lifetime and friends that have been with me through the
            worst and best times.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way that I am able to serve others is through my church<a href="https://www.grace-bible.org/">Grace Bible Church</a>.
          I had the opportunity to lead a bible study and it was something that I am so thankful for. I wanted to share my passion for
            God and the bible and help students like my Bible study leaders helped me. Little did I know that I would grow so much from
            that experience as well. I wanted to serve others and I definitely got to do that, but I got so much more out of it than I
            would have thought. I learned how to put others above myself, how to be dependant on God, how to be obedient to God, and so
            much more. I gained so many amazing frienships with people that push me to be better and challenge me. Words cannot describe
            how thankful I am that I got to lead a bible study and am excited to see what the future brings with these people.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing that I have gotten to be a part of is getting serve children all over the world this summer
          through a Nonprofit called <a href="http://www.compassion.com">Compassion International</a>. Compassion’s mission
          statement is “Releasing Children from Poverty in Jesus’ Name.” I interned
          for Compassion as a Software Developer intern so not only did I get to serve children,
          I also got to do it by coding which is something that I love doing. And I did it as my job. Not sure if this would count
            count as service since it was my job, but I am truly thankful to work for Compassion because I get to use my coding skills
            in a way that I love.

            I serve in these ways because I love getting to bring glory to the King of Kings and lord of lords. If you are reading this
            and do not know why I devote my life and my free time to serve God, I will tell you! We live in a broken world, and you can see
            that if you look around you or watch the news. There is so much injustice and hurt and pain. Humans try to get out of that brokeness
            in different ways, maybe by being successful or making a lot of money. Maybe it's by partying or numbing the pain that
            this world brings through alcohol or other distractions. These things don't satisfy us because we were created for something so much
            greater. Something that does satisfy us. When God created the heavens and the earth, then man and woman, everything was good. We
            were in relationship with God which was what we were created for. But then man sinned against and disobeyed God and that caused a separation
            between man and God because God is holy and humanity is sinful. That sin resulted in this broken world that we see today. The punishment
            for sin is death which is eternal separation from God. We are all sinners and do bad and selfish things, But God in his great love sent
            his son to this world. His son Jesus, lived the perfect life that we cannot live, and died on the cross for our sins, paying for the punishment that
            we deserve. But Jesus did not stay dead, he had victory over sin and death and resurrected 3 days later. Because of the payment that
            Jesus payed for us, instead of eternal separation from God, we get to have eternal life with God. To accept the free gift God of eternal life,
            all we have to do is turn from our sin and believe that Jesus died on the cross for our sins. Then we get to have a
            life in relationship with our Creator. There we find full satisfaction, Joy, Peace, and even greater love than we can imagine!
